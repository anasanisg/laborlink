## Overview

### Project Description
LaborLink is a fully integratable enterprise system designed for renting labor tools to researchers, students, and hobbyists. It includes a powerful pipeline that effectively tracks customer activities, detects fraudulent behavior, and provides invoices to end customers. The system leverages modern technologies for communication and data processing and is built with future horizontal scaling in mind. Additionally, it supports integration with external third parties (e.g., delivery of labor cards or collaboration with other LaborLink provider companies).

### Architecture: Event-Driven Design with Kafka as the Communication Backbone

## Enviroment & Services

Backend is generally based on Java and Python.

//------- *Developments Tools* ----------------

ðŸ“¦ Apache Maven 3.9.9

ðŸ“¦ Python => 3.12 & (3.13.1) Recommended

ðŸ“¦ JDK 17.0.13 2024-10-15 LTS

//------- *Databases* ----------------

ðŸ“ˆ MariaDB 11.6.2

ðŸ“ˆ MongoDB mongodb-community@6.0

//------- *External Servers* ----------------

ðŸ‘” Apache Kafka 3.6.0 - Scala 2.13 (Communication Backbone)

ðŸ‘” Apache Flink 1.20.0 Scala 2.12 (ETL Stream Data Processing)

ðŸ‘” Keycloak 26.1.0 (Open Identity Provider)

//------- *Ports & UI* ----------------

âœ¨ Keycloak --PORT:8080, UI: http://localhost:8080

âœ¨ Gateway --PORT:8087, UI:NONE, *However we hv provided a POSTMAN-COLLECTION*

âœ¨ Kafka --PORT:9092, UI:NONE

âœ¨ Flink --PORT:8081, UI: http://localhost:8081/

âœ¨ Tool Service --PORT:8082, UI:, *However we hv provided a POSTMAN-COLLECTION*

âœ¨ Renting Machine Service --PORT:8084, *However we hv provided a POSTMAN-COLLECTION*

âœ¨ Activity Service --PORT:8083,UI:, *However we hv provided a POSTMAN-COLLECTION*

âœ¨ Invoice Service --PORT:8085,UI:, *However we hv provided a POSTMAN-COLLECTION*

*Note* in common scenarios the activtiy, tool and invoice services are internal services and should be accessed only through API Gateway for authorization but we have also provide a postman collection for them for testing so in general:
    - In Gateway provinding a Acess Token is Required.
    - for Direct Calling internal services then providing Acess Token not required

### Confirue KeyCloack IdentityProvider
Keycloak is our IdentityProvider it's responsible of Authentication and managing roles for users. With keycloak we hv also the ability to integrate other third-part Organization (eg Other Laborlink-Service-Providers, Delivars Services etc) and Keycloak can handle and manage roles in perfect way.

We have right know three Roles *Labor-User*,*Labor-Manager* and *Labor-Developer(optional)*.

Auth Process In General .. user sends req payloaded with JWT >gateway>keycloak>gateway>routing.

*Note* Now we are going to configure keycloak with Confendential Client, in our EAI the Client secret is existed in the frontend which not a best practice for authentication. In common scenarios a public client or an Authentication Service are used to handle Authentication from the frontend side.So this just for demonstration purposes to represent the authentication flow process.

Reproduce Configurations:

Step 1: Please start keycloak
```bash
# Server Starts on http://localhost:8080
make start-kc
```

Step 2: After creation an adminstator account please create a LaborLink Realm like this image below:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="imgs/kc-0.png" alt="Description" width="200" height="200">
</div>

Step 3: From the *Realm Setting* tab on the left side please click on Login tab please enable *User registration* toggle. (This will allow users for self registration).

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="imgs/kc-1.png" alt="Description" width="200" height="200">
</div>

Step 4: From the *Authentication* tab on the left side, please click on *Required Actions* and disable *Configure OTP : OFF*, *Update Password : OFF*, *Update Profile : OFF*, *Verify Email: OFF* and *Verify Profile OFF* to make the registration simple as possible.


Step 5: From the *Realm roles* tab on the left side please create three roles: *labor-user*, *labor-manager* and *labor-developer*. 

Step 6: From *Realm Setting* tab on the left side please click on *User Registration* the last tab and asign the *labor-user* role to each client. In this way this role will be distrubuted as initial role for *user-client* and each other new client.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="imgs/kc-2.png" alt="Description" width="full-width" height="200">
</div>

Step 7: From *Clients* tab on the left side, please create a client with id *user-client* and enable OIDC *Client authentication* as well as *Service accounts roles*


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="imgs/kc-3.png" alt="Description" width="full-width" height="200">
</div>

Step 8: A *Valid redirect URIs* should be our frontend which is http://localhost:3000/

*Note* We can asign *labor-manager* role to any user manually through *Users* tab on the left side

*Note* To get client secret, please click on *Clients* tab on the left side then to *user-client*. From *Crendential* we can copy it.

### Configure & Start Kafka 
Kafka acts as a centralized hub or a communication backbone in Laborlink. Its the main components that connect the internal services with each other.



```bash
# To generate a random-uuid and format the storage of kafka
make prepare-kafka

# To Run Kafka Cluster 
make start-kafka

# Exec in another terminal to create kafka topics
make create-kafka-topics
```

*Note* in LaborLink we are managing the events in three topics *tool.rental.events*, *activity.record.events*, *activity.complete.events*

### Configure & Start Flink
Flink Cluster in Laborlink used for ETL Stream Data Processing. It's used in general to process renting and returning activities to calculate the Total Price in realtime as well as to detect the customer return all the tools or not. Then publisch an event to notify the activity and invoice service.

We can say flink is a Cluster who host ETL Batch and Stream Data Processing jobs. We have no Batch Processing, however flink support eg (Batch Processing to collect the Data from all resources mongoDB, mariaDB etc organize them then insert the organized data in a DB warehouse).

Current Existed Job is for stream Processing to detect Fraud & calculate total price out of the box.


```bash
# To package the Job in Jar in out/.. files in order to deploy it into flask
make package-tool-rental-job 
```


```bash
# Start flink cluster
make start-flink

# NOTE Flink runs in background and it will not terminated by just closing the terminal
# To Stop Cluster 
make stop-flink
```

The easiest way to deploy a flink job by flink UI http://localhost:8081/ . So please open the flink dashboard then from *Submit New Job* on the left side upload *toolrentalflow-1.0.jar* from *out/...* directory.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="imgs/flink-0.png" alt="Description" width="full-width" height="200">
</div>


Before Submitting the Job please make sure that Kafka broker is running then after 5-10 sec the job status should be running.

### Reproduce Backend

#### Reproduce Gateway
Gateway is used in Laborlink for Authorization tokens comming from the Presentation Layers (Labor User/Admin Dashboard) through Keycloak. 

```bash
# this will produce and executable Jar file under path out/
make package-gateway
```

**Note:** if keycloak not configured like above please make sure first that the authorization point in (Issuer Url) is matching the current realm in Keycloack like this prop below before packaging:

```bash
# Configurations could be found in backend/gateway/src/main/resources/
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://localhost:8080/realms/<Your-Realm-Name>
```

#### Reproduce Tool Service 
Tool Service is controlling with all CRUD Operations to register the tools in Laborlink Laager.

Please make sure the MariaDB JDBC configurations under path *backend/tool-service/src/main/java/resources/application-dev.properties* are configured to match your DB Configurations

```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/<your-db-name>
spring.datasource.username=<username>
spring.datasource.password=<password>
```

```bash
# this will produce and executable Jar file under path out/
make package-ts
```

#### Reproduce Renting Machine Service 
Renting Machine Service is a simulation for legacy system where the users can interact with a monitor (We simulate the monitor-presentationLayer- with frontend). In this machine the user chose the tools he want to rent and scan his card to complete the process


Please make sure the MariaDB JDBC configurations under path *backend/renting-machine-service/src/main/java/resources/application-dev.properties* are configured to match your DB Configurations

```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/<your-db-name>
spring.datasource.username=<username>
spring.datasource.password=<password>
```

```bash
# this will produce and executable Jar file under path out/
make package-rms
```

#### Reproduce Activity Service Service 
Activity Service is used to track the Activities and their status in the Enterprise so the CRM can know clearly whats the current opened renting contracts and they have also the ability to now if the customer has return all tools with the same quantity or not.

Please make sure the MariaDB JDBC configurations under path *backend/activity-service/src/main/java/resources/application-dev.properties* are configured to match your DB Configurations

```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/<your-db-name>
spring.datasource.username=<username>
spring.datasource.password=<password>
```

```bash
# this will produce and executable Jar file under path out/
make package-as
```

#### Reproduce Invoice Service 
Invoice Service form its name used to produce the an invoice for user related to the activity he made.

*Note* this service is connected to NOSQL database to demonstrate a multiple DB EAI. 

```bash
#Please change DBUrl to yours if its not matched *backend/invoice-service/.env*
export DB_CLIENT=mongodb://localhost:<your-port>/
# By Default mongo runs on 27017
```

*Note* this service is a Flask Python backend so the dependencies should be installed first in order to execute the flask app. Please run the command bellow to install deps.

```bash
# Create Virtual Env to a void the installation on your global Libs
python3 -m venv backend/invoice-service/env 
make install-is-deps
```



### Starting Backend
*Note* Please make sure first that kafka, flink and keyloak are running.

**Note* Please make sure that the databases are working, if the installation is done through homebrew you can execute these commands to start the databases.

```bash
# Start MariaDB
brew services start mariadb
# Start MongoDB
brew services start mongodb-community@6.0
# To check if they are running 
brew services list 
```

 Please run these commands to run the executable jar files in *out/...* that we have already produced

```bash
# Run API Gateway 
make run-gateway
# Run Tool Service - JAVA
make run-ts
# Run Renting Machine Service - JAVA
make run-rms
# Run Activity Service - JAVA
make run-as
# Run Invoice Service - PYTHON
